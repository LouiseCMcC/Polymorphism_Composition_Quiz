# Polymorphism_Composition_Quiz

Polymorphism

What does the word 'polymorphism' mean?

the ability of an object to take many forms.

What does it mean when we apply polymorphism to OO design? Give a simple Java example.

Polymorphism is an object-oriented programming (OOP) concept that refers to the ability of a variable, function or object to take on multiple forms.

an example in java would be a child class inheriting properties and methods from a parent class.

What can we use to implement polymorphism in Java?

How many 'forms' can an object take when using polymorphism?

there is no limit.

Give an example of when you could use polymorphism.

if you had several classes in a java programme containing the same method, you could create an interface that contains this method and implement this in these classes.

Composition and Aggregation

What do we mean by 'composition' in reference to object-oriented programming?

Composition is the design technique in object-oriented programming to implement has-a relationship between objects

When would you use composition? Provide a simple example in Java.

a property stored in a variable in a class object, or a method stored in an interface that is implemented in a class.

Give a difference between composition and aggregation?

objects can exist independently from the object which contains them.

What is/are the advantage(s) of using composition/aggregation?

composition allows selectivity of methods/properties pulled through, whereas inheritance does not.

you cant change any properties or methods of a parent class that is inherited by child classes or it will cause the program to break.

When using composition, when an object is destroyed, what happens to all the objects it is composed of?

the objects cease to exist.

When using aggregation, when an object is destroyed, what happens to all the objects it is composed of?

the objects cease to exist.
